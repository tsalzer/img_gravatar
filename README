= Gravatar

$Id$

A simple plugin adding the +gravatar+ image capability to ActionViews.

== What is a Gravatar?

A gravatar is a globally recognized avatar. It is an image hosted on the site
http://site.gravatar.com, uploaded by the user and referred to on base of
an eMail address. News on gravatar can be found at http://blog.gravatar.com.

Each gravatar image can be rated with respect to its content being suiteable to
audience.

== Usage

To use a gravatar on your system, your view needs the eMail address of the
individual to be displayed. The most simple case is like this:

  <p>
    <%= gravatar('me@email.com') %> That's me.
  </p>

This will render the image of the person known under the eMail me@email.com
in your browser. If there is no person known with this name, it will render
the Gravatar logo.

A more complex szenario would include a size definition, and an alt image tag:

  <p>
    <%= gravetar('me@email.com', { :size => 40, :alt => "That's me." }) %>
  </p>

This would render a downsized image of 40x40 with the alt-tag "That's me.".

For a complete description of available parameters see
