= Image Gravatar

A simple plugin adding the +img_gravatar+ image link helper to ActionViews.

== Install

The gem is hosted on http://gemcutter.org, which is the default Ruby gem
hoster at this time (November 2009). All you need to install the latest
version is run the following command:

  gem install img_gravatar


== What is a Gravatar?

A gravatar is a globally recognized avatar. It is an image hosted on the site
http://site.gravatar.com, uploaded by the user and referred to on base of
an eMail address. News on gravatar can be found at http://blog.gravatar.com.

Each gravatar image can be rated with respect to its content being suitable
for a given audience. You might want to use the rating feature if you run a
public site.

== Usage

To use a gravatar on your system, your view needs the eMail address of the
individual to be displayed. The most simple case is like this:

  <p>
    <%= img_gravatar('me@email.com') %> That's me.
  </p>

This will render the image of the person known under the eMail me@email.com
in your browser. If there is no person known with this name, it will render
the Gravatar logo.

A more complex szenario would include a size definition, and an alt image tag:

  <p>
    <%= img_gravetar('me@email.com', { :size => 40, :alt => "That's me." }) %>
  </p>

This would render a downsized image of 40x40 with the alt-tag "That's me.".

For a complete description of available parameters see
ImgGravatar::InstanceMethods#gravatar in the ImgGravatar::InstanceMethods.

=== Configuration Options

You can modify the following aspects of the displayed gravatar image:
 * :alt          - the alternative text for this image
 * :default_url  - the default URL for this gravatar
 * :size         - the requested gravatar size
 * :rating       - the requested maximum rating

== Building a new Gem

To create a new gem, you need to install the jeweler gem (see
http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/echoe/files/README.html).
Next, edit the Rakefile to reflect your changes, then run:

  rake clobber        # remove generated stuff for a clean manifest
  rake manifest       # only needed if you changed the file set
  rake build_gemspec  # update the gemspec

Now, you can either publish the gem, or build a gem package. See rake -T for
available targets.
